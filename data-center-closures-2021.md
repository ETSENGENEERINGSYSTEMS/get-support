{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} invests significantly in data center infrastructure. These investments include rolling out 
newer data centers and multizone regions (MZRs) designed to deliver a more resilient architecture with higher levels of 
network throughput and redundancy. For more information, see 
[Locations for resource deployment](/docs/overview?topic=overview-locations).

Part of this modernization strategy is to close older data centers that are unsuitable for upgrading. As this transition 
approaches, help is available to assist you in your migration to modern data centers. For more information, see
